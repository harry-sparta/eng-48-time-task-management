# Time and Tasks Management
## Notes from training


### Useful applications
- Outlook (Calendar, to do list)
- Trello (To do list as a Scrum board)
- Rescue Time (Time log on tasks durations)
- Stay Focused (Remainder to focus)


### Time box
- Planning ahead and quantifying tasks in time blocks
- Allocating time blocks effectively into the available Time
- Can also assigning urgency and importance to each time block (combining with Eisenhower method)


### Eisenhower method
- Visualise a 2x2 matrix: Where one axis is urgency and the other is importance
- Allocate Urgent or Not Urgent to a task
- Also allocate Importance or Not Important to a task
- Summing up the number (4=UI, 3=U or I, 2=<blank>)
- This allows task to be prioritised quickly. Making it very effective to tasks that consistently changes importance and urgency.


### Pareto law
- Pareto Law is a 80/20 rule based on the Pareto distribution
- It could be applied in many circumstances but needs to be taken with a pinch of salt
- Focus on tasks that generates 80% of overall results using 20% of input. As a form of prioritisation.
